description = "Provides functionality for requesting a response to a field, and displays a warning to survey respondents if any requested fields are missing a value. For completeness, this module also allows required fields to be treated in the same way. Fields can be annotated with @REQUESTED or @REQUIRED, both of which take an optional description, which is shown to the user. If the description is omitted, the field label is shown instead."
